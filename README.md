# Background apps/software

This is just a collection of the apps I have running in the background on my mac that I think other people would like.
* Alfred, text expansion, workflows, clipboard history, file search etc, free but to get all the feature here I think it's Â£20 https://www.alfredapp.com/
* Rectangle, window manager to snap things to left/right of screen, full screen etc, free, https://rectangleapp.com/
* CleanShot X, insane screenshot tool, lets you annotate as soon as you've taken pictures, scrolling capture, OCR (I've set mine to cmd-shift-2), puts pin of screenshot over screen so you can quickly drag and drop into file, $30, https://cleanshot.com/
* Meeter, looks through calanders for videocall links and organises them all in menu bar to join with one click, free, https://trymeeter.com/
* Flux, changes screen brightness/contrast throughout day, free, https://justgetflux.com/
* Hand mirror, litterally just a button in the menu bar you can click to quickly toggle your front camera on/off, free, https://handmirror.app/
* Spoftify widget, mac notification centres have no way to control spotify so this is a widget someone built that lets you play/pause from the notification centre, also makes background of widget the album art, free, https://github.com/fabiusBile/Spotify4BigSur
* Stylus, Chrome extension to alter websites CSS, free, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en/
